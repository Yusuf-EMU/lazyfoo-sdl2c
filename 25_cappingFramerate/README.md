# Changes

* added common variables used to calculate frame rate in `common.c` and `common.h` as will be used in main source file.
* Use `-DDISABLE_FPS_CALC` as `CFLAGS` to disable framerate calculation feature.
* Try to change `TARGET_FPS` in main source file (`.c`) to different value to see the effect i.e. 30.
