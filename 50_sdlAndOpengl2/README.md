# Note

* For portable code, use `#include "gl.h"` and `#include "glu.h"` and use `I....<your header directory page>...` in your Makefile. So it's easier to port code to other platforms.
* `LWindow` is modified for its `LWindow_new()` function to not create renderer if input window flags included `SDL_WINDOW_OPENGL`. This allows us to continue using this class further.
* (Further optimization) to reduce executable filesize due to unused symbols are inside the binary, refer to [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6687630/how-to-remove-unused-c-c-symbols-with-gcc-and-ld), [this](https://embeddedfreak.wordpress.com/2009/02/10/removing-unused-functionsdead-codes-with-gccgnu-ld/), and [this](https://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc-help/2003-08/msg00128.html). Or another way is to split one big system into sub-system spanning across multiple header files. So source file will include only necessary; eliminate unused symbols from linking against object file in the first place.
* Header files of related OpenGL can be found on macOS at `xcode-select -p`/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.14.sdk/System/Library/Frameworks/OpenGL.framework/Headers in which version of macOS can be changed. When linking the program, use `-framework OpenGL`.
