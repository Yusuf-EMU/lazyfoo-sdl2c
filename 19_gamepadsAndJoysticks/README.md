Use `make joysticks-sample` to bulid joystick-based sub-sample for this tutorial.
Use `make controllers-sample` to build controller-based sub-sample for this tutorial.

The difference between the twos is to tell SDL to initailize which sub-system (joystick or controller)
which will have an effect on operating in the code to get information from axis motion of either joystick of gamepad.

To build all use `make` or `make all`.
